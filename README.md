# directional_connectome
## Introduction
The idea of this project is to use directional connectome information from tracing studies of the macaque brain to generate a directed version of the human structural connectome. I have created a mapping of human brain regions in the Desikan-Killiany (DK) atlas to analagous regions of the macaque brain in the RM atlas (Kotter and Wanke, 2005) using anatomical and functional similarities derived from literature search.
The RM atlas is based on gross anatomical features (gyri and sulci), as is the DK atlas. Region mappings were first assessed visually by warping/ aligning the two atlases using analagous anatomical features (see png) and then confirmed if they shared a label in Brodmann's human parcellation (http://cocomac.g-node.org/downloads/regionalmap.pdf)
## The pitfall
Cocomac data cannot actually be used to infer directionality of connections between brain regions. In order to confirm that a connection is directional, tracers would have to be injected into both source and target regions and the amount of tracer present in both source and target would have to be reliably quantified. Thus, as stated in Blumenfeld et al., 2013, all that can be determined from cocomac data "is whether each connection of interest is present, absent, or unknown".
