# directional_connectome
## Introduction
The idea of this project is to use directional connectome information from tracing studies of the macaque brain to generate a directed version of the human structural connectome. I have created a mapping of human brain regions in the Desikan-Killiany (DK) atlas to analagous regions of the macaque brain in the RM atlas (Kotter and Wanke, 2005) using anatomical and functional similarities derived from literature search.
The RM atlas is based on gross anatomical features (gyri and sulci), as is the DK atlas. Region mappings were first assessed visually by warping/ aligning the two atlases using analagous anatomical features (see png) and then confirmed if they shared a label in Brodmann's human parcellation (http://cocomac.g-node.org/downloads/regionalmap.pdf)
