# directional_connectome
## Introduction
The idea of this project is to use directional connectome information from tracing studies of the macaque brain to generate a directed version of the human structural connectome. I have created a mapping of human brain regions in the Desikan-Killiany (DK) atlas to analagous regions of the macaque brain in the Felleman and Van Essen atlas (FV91) using anatomical and functional similarities derived from literature search.
